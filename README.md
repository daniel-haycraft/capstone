my capstone project!

INSTALLATION

type these into your terminal in the cap workspace
npm init -y

npm i axios 

npm i cors express

npm i path

make sure when installing check the index.js folder and look for require axios, if there is.. delete it!

GETTING TO THE URL...

since i have middleware set up you need to either deploy it to a website like heroku or go to 
http://localhost:4001/?

winner winner chicken dinner
if you win make sure your volume is on! if you're an OG i hope you enjoy:)

SMALL THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR!

hover your mouse over the pokeballs to get a little surpise each time

if you miss click on the pokemon you want and want to choose another click the image instead of the battle mode button! 
don't worry that pokemon will be at the bottom of the list so if you change your mindback 
you can always play as them!

HOPE YOU ENJOY!
